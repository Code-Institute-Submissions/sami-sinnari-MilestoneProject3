### Design
- The design of this project is based on simplicity. Mostly, Materialize was used as their templates bring attractive and nicely-set look. Scroll-over background image has been used which gives an accurate meaning to the page on first glance.

#### Colors

- I've used four colors throughout the site.

#### Typography

- I used only one font for this website. The name of the font is : Raleway, and it was taken from Google Fonts. I decided to use Raleway as it presents more modern look. It is clear to read and pairs nicely.
